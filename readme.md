# AI Proxy Server

Simple backend proxy API to handle requests between your macOS SwiftUI app and the Mistral AI API (or another third-party AI API).


## Get Started

1. `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. `npm run dev` for having nodemon running to the server restarting automatically on file changes.


## Other Commands
* `npm run start` - start as standard mode the server (without nodemon). Server doesn't restart on file changes.
* `npm run build` - compile the TS files.
