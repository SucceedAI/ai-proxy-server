# SucceedAI: An AI Proxy API that Securely Serves Client Applications

SucceedAI API is a proxy backend API that securely handles requests between a client app and AI 3rd-party provider APIs (such as OpenAI, MistralAI, and Anthropic's Claude).


At the moment, it includes the following AI APIs 🚀

- **OpenAI**
- **Mistral AI**
- **Claude 3 (Anthropic)**


## Get Started

1. `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. `npm run dev` for having nodemon running to the server restarting automatically on file changes.
3. Rename `.env.dist` to `.env` and edit the details in there.


### Other Commands

- `npm run start` - start as standard mode the server (without nodemon). Server doesn't restart on file changes.
- `npm run prod` - more optimized for a production environment. This command will first run `npm run build` and then use `node` to execute the JavaScript compiled file.
- `npm run build` - only to compile the TS files into ones.


### Utility

- `npm run prettier:check`– check any formatting/indentation errors.
- `npm run prettier:fix` – fix any formatting/indentation errors.
